		<h3 id="">Scheduling your Fastpasses</h3>
		<p>Last time I posted we were 100 days out and I was discussing what was coming up next in my Disney Planning. The main thing was figuring out fast passes. When you stay at the resort you have the ability to schedule fastpasses 60 days out. Well today marks that day. In my last post, I listed what I was going to attempt to get for my fastpasses. Today I’ll list what I actually got for Fastpasses.</p>

<h4>Day 1: Animal Kingdom</h4>
	<ol> 
		<li> Kilimanjaro Safaris</li>
		<li> Na’vi River Journey (new ride in Pandora)</li>
		<li> Festival of the Lion King </li>
	</ol>
<p>This is not a typo. I actually got every attraction I wanted from my previous post. I’m looking forward to riding the new Pandora section featuring Na’vi River Journey the most.</p> 

	<h4>Day 2: Magic Kingdom</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Seven Dwarfs Mine Train</li>
		<li>Buzz Space Ranger Spin</li>
		<li>Peter Pan’s Flight</li>
	</ol>
<p>I switched things up some here. You will notice down on my 2nd day that I pulled a switcharoo. I decided to stay on the Fantasyland and Tomorrowland side of the park on day 2 so I chose to put Peter’s Pan flight on Day two as opposed to day 4.</p>
	
	<h4>Day 3: Hollywood Studios</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Toy Story Midway Mania</li>
		<li>Star Tours</li>
		<li>Frozen Sing Along for my little girls</li>
		<li>Tower of Terror for me and my Son</li>
	</ol>
<p>Another little switcharoo. That’s the beauty of planning at the 100 day mark what you are hoping to do. I decided I did not want to watch Frozen. I also figured my only son would not want to watch Frozen either, so decided to fastpass Tower of Terror for us.</p>

	<h4>Day 4: Magic Kingdom</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Haunted Mansion for me and my older two kids</li>
		<li>Enchanted Tales with Belle for the younger two</li>
		<li>Jungle Cruise</li>
		<li>Big Thunder Mountain Railroad</li>
	</ol>
<p>I decided to take a playbook from the Hollywood Studios visit and split up the Fastpasses for the kids. I have two older kids that really enjoy Haunted Mansion but two younger ones that would not like it. So we will split the two and visit something more age appropriate. I think this will work out just fine (plus I get out of another Princess experience).</p>

<p>So what’s left? Well at 60 days out, not much except get some final things out of the way. You can pay off your balance if you haven’t done so already. You can pick your Magic Bands. You can at 30 days out go ahead and pick what you want to eat and pre-order it ahead of your visit at participating restaurants. Finally, you can begin getting some essentials for your trip. The trip is getting closer and closer now and I am getting more and more excited. My kids do not know about the trip yet so that’s also exciting. They may get mad when I wake them up super early the day we leave but once they figure it out its going to be priceless to see their faces.</p>
