              <p>We have some many favorites from our last trip and hope to add some new favorites from this next trip. I'll post some favorites below broken up by Park. I'll add Epcot even though as a family we did not go last time and don't plan on going this time due to the age of our kids, but I do have a few favorites from my childhood that I'll include.</p>

              			<li>Seven Dwarfs Mine Train</li>
              				<iframe width="360" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9A4vjeYLcXw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
              				<p>Seven Dwarf Mine Train was a very enjoyable ride. Had some good drops and had just enough thrill. Lines for this ride stay long all day. This should be a FastPass priority.</p>
              			<li>Dumbo the Flying Elephant</li>
              				<iframe width="360" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xG1-oQ4xZ1M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
              				<p>Having young kids you'll see a lot of rides that are easy and simple and wouldn't scare many young kids. We rode Dumbo at least a half dozen times on our last trip. Our 5 year old was just shy of 3 the last time we went and she love Dumbo!</p>
              			<li>Pirates of the Caribbean</li>
							<iframe width="360" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V6DB7aS93PU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<p>Ok,Ok so maybe this is my favorite ride. My kids liked it a lot but this is a classic ride that I enjoyed as a kid. I still remember as a kid the dog with the keys and the Pirates begging the dog for the keys.</p>
		             
		  			
		  <ul class="epcot">Epcot</ul>
		  					<li>Living with the Land</li>
		  						<iframe width="360" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vLhIHjrR0wg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		  						<p>Many do not care for this ride, but when I was young I remember how much my grandmother enjoyed it. This is added for that reason alone.</p>
		  					<li>Soarin'</li>
		  						<iframe width="360" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZcoMxGNL46k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		  							<p>This ride has changed since my childhood, but it has been upgraded for the better. I think everyone will enjoy this ride.</p>
		  				 
		  				 
		  <ul class="ak">Animal Kingdom</ul>
		  				 	<li>Kilimanjaro Safaris</li>
		  				 		<iframe width="360" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9z3K0p7RN1k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		  				 			<p>Must do at Animal Kingdom. My whole family thoroughly enjoyed this experience.</p>
		  				 	<li>Festival of the Lion King</li>
		  				 			<p>This show is too good to limit it to a Youtube clip. You will have to experience this show live and tell me what you think.</p>
		  				
		  <ul class="hs">Hollywood Studios</ul>
		  				  	<li>Toy Story Midway Mania</li>
		  				  		<iframe width="360" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-UHImcPKogI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		  				  		<p>This is one of my favorite rides throughout the entire Disney World Resort. It was super fun for all of my kids. My 3 year old may have or may not have beaten me in this game.</p> <br>
