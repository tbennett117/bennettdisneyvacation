		<h3>Why the Caribbean:</h3>
			<p>There were a couple of factors for why we chose the Caribbean Resort. The main reason was that it would be our only chance to stay here. Our youngest doesn't count as a full "person" and the Caribbean's max occupancy is 5. So while we have 6 staying, she will most likely be in a pack in play or maybe just sleeping between someone else. If we decide to go back later then we will have to get a Family Suite and Caribbean doesn't offer family suites. Another reason is the pool. While we are going in November and the temps will be low, we are hoping to still spend time in the pool. The layout of the pool reminds me of "The Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl" The architecture and landscaping was too beautiful to pass up. Also another reason was the price. It was actually cheaper than the Value resorts we could stay at. This is because of the Family Suites. The value resorts would offer us more room, but most our time would be spent in the park and a 2 year old isn't going to be taking up that much room. So all those factors led us to the Caribbean Resort and I'm excited to go in November.
