              <h2 class="plan">Our Plan</h2>
            <p>Our Disney Vacation plan began as soon as we returned from our first trip. In April 2015 we went to Disney with my mother who purchased the trip as a gift. After we returned we knew we wanted to go back. We set a time-frame that we thought would work. Below you will find the steps we took to plan for this trip.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pick a Date</li>
                    <p>Like I indicated above. We knew we wanted to go back to Disney as soon as we returned. We planned to go during Free Dining that Disney offers during the fall, however that didn't quiet work out. We just missed free dining, but still decided November would work best. When choosing a date you have to look at crowd calendars, special events, spring breaks, and many other factors.</p>
                <li>Pick where you are going to stay.</li>
                	<p>The main thing we knew was that we wanted to stay onsite. There are many perks to staying on site, but the main reason for us, was to feel the Magic of Disney. We ended up choosing Caribbean Beach Resort. We chose Caribbean because it fit our budget and our family. Typically this resort only allows 5 people and we are a family of 6, but our 2 year didnt count as a whole person. Depending on the size of your family will most likely dictate where you stay. Disney has Value, Moderate, Deluxe, and Campsites. You can visit the hotels <a class="stay" href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/resorts/">here.</a></p>
                <li>Figure out a Plan</li>
                    <p>You need to figure out your daily plan this early in the process because you need to know where you will be when you decide to schedule your dining reservations. Also typically Disney releases Park <a class="calendar" href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/calendars/">Hours</a> and this is good information to have as you plan your trip. For instance we are going during Mickey's Christmas Party. Because of this the Park closes at 7:00p.m. on those days. So our first day going to parks there is a Party scheduled so we will be visiting Animal Kingdom that day. It's also a good idea to look at the calendar to see which parks will have Extra Magic Hours. Extra Magic Hours means you can get into the park earlier or they stay open later. So its a good thing to plan what park you will visit each day of your trip so you can know Park hours and where you want to plan your dining.</p>
                <li>Schedule Dining</li>
                    <p>When you schedule your trip whether you pick a Disney Dining Plan or not, you at least want to make reservations if you plan on eating at some of the restaurants in the Parks. We chose to do the Disney Dining Plan. We were hoping for the free dining, but even if we didn't get it we still wanted the all-inclusive feel. There are a lot of great places to eat. You can begin making reservations 180 days out from your trip. You can see all the dining options <a class="dining" href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/">here.</a></p>
                <li>Park Touring Plan and Fast Passes</li>
                    <p>Now that you know what Park you are visiting each day and what restaurants you will be eating at its now time to figure out your plan for each day. I suggest looking at a Park Map and mapping out your day. Our plan looks like this: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Day 1--Arrival day: Eat at Chef Mickey's</li>
                            <li>Day 2--Animal Kingdom</li>
                            <li> Day 3--Magic Kingdom</li>
                            <li>Day 4--Hollywood Studios</li>
                            <li>Day 5--Magic Kingdom</li>
                            <li>Day 6--Leave Disney</li>
                        </ul>  
                
                    Included in this part of the plan is scheduling your FastPasses. If you are staying onsite like us you can schedule your FastPasses 60 days before your trip. If you are staying offsite then it is 30 days. You may have your daily plan set up prior to FastPass selections so depending on what time you get your FastPasses for the attractions you want you may have to update your plan slightly. For example: If you got a FastPass for Space Mountain and its for 11:00 but you planned on being in Adventure Land around that time you may want to adjust your schedule.</p>
                <li>Get Ready to Go!</li>
                        <p>This part is planning out your driving route, packing, and figure out what time to leave. The main thing is don't forget key items like your Magic Bands. I also recommend downloading the My Disney Experience App for your phone. This will help you keep up with your FastPass Selections and Dining Reservations. It also has a Map to help you find things easier if you've never been.</p>

          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Crazy Dad to 4 crazy kids. I love the whole Disney experience. I visited when I was 5 with my grandparents and loved it. I visited again when I was 12 and again it was a Magical Experience. Unfortunately I did not get to visit again until 2015, but I got to experience it with my kids. Disney is the most Magical Place on earth and my kids and I had a great time. Our second trip is on the calendar and we scheduled to visit in November 2017.</p>
