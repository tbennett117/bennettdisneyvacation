      		<p class="one">In the Spring of 2015 we took our trip to Walt Disney World Resort and stayed at Art of Animation. This was our first experience at a resort. When I was growing up we often stayed off-site. We really enjoyed our experience staying on-site at the Art of Animation.</p>
      		<p class="two">My first impression as I pulled up to the resort was this is exaclty what I was hoping for. It had all the Disney ambiance that make this Resort magical. As soon as you walk into the main lobby you are greeted by animated sketches to many of your favorite Disney and Pixar Classics. To the left you have the gift shop that is aptly called: Ink and Paint Gift Shop. If you keep going on the right you have the Arcade. The arcade wasn't very big, but when you are at Disney why would you want to spend a lot of timing playing games? As you walk through the Lobby and out the back sliding doors you view the beautiful "Big Blue Pool". This a state of the Art pool that has music that you can listen to under the water, and a swim up bar. At nights you can view a movie poolside or just relax under the stars. The Resort itself features four different themed rooms: 
      			<ul>
      				<li>Finding Nemo</li>
      				<li>The Lion King</li>
      				<li>The Little Mermaid</li>
      				<li>Cars</li>
      			</ul>
      		</p>
      		<p class="three">Art of Animation is listed among the Value Resorts but the stay felt more like a Moderate. It has family suites that can lodge up to 6 people. Disney had families in mind when they created this Resort as it targets the intended audience. Not that a older couple without kids wouldn't enjoy staying at this resort its just obvious that this resort is directed towards families with younger children. Even my middle child who wasn't quiet 3 at the time saw the pelicans on top of the Nemo section and yelled "mine, mine, mine!" </p>

      		<p class="four">Since we only stayed in the Cars section I can only review that section of the resort. The theme was awesome from the life-like looking Lightening, Mater, and the rest of the gang surrounding this section, to the Cozy Cone's surrounding the pool. The rooms themselves were a little over-the-top but it fit the theme perfectly. We had 3 adults, 3 children, and 1 infant in a Family Suite. The fold out couch, murphy bed, and the private room were more than enough room for our group. We didn't spend a lot of time in our room because we wanted to enjoy the parks, but the time spent did not feel to restricted. With two full baths we had more than enough room to get showers, and get ready for our day or our meal. </p>
      		
      		<p class="five">The Food Court at Art of Animation was called Landscape of Flavors. I personally liked the breakfast. Every morning you could go to a different station and get whatever you wanted to eat for that day. There was a waffle station, egg station and of course there was a place to get pastries and donuts. We only had dinner at our Resort one night and 1 Quick Service credit got us a large Pizza that we all split. Overall it was a hectic atmosphere at the food court but the Disney Cast members worked hard to get you what you needed and through the line efficiently. </p>
      		
      		<p class="six">Overall I thought that Art of Animation was a great place to stay for a family. We had enough space for sleep and showers, the landscaping was beautiful and had walking trails and a view of Hourglass Lake. The Cars theme was great, but so were the other themes even though we primarily stayed in our Cars Resort. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the kids loved seeing the sketches on the walls of the lobby, the lifelike replicas of Lightening McQueen and Mater, and the Big Blue Pool. I would highly recommend staying at Art of Animation to anyone looking to book a value resort that has enough space for a larger family. </p>
