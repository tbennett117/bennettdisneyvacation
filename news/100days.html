		<h3 id="100_header">Less than 100 days</h3>
		
		<p>So we are less than 100 days away from our family trip to Disney. So, what’s left before our Trip? There are some obvious things that need to take place before your trip, but there also might be some not-so-obvious things you have left to do. In this post I hope to show what we have left to do before we go in November and also help you as you plan your trip.</p> 
	<h3>Tying up loose ends</h3>
		<p> So far along the way we have scheduled our dining (180 days out) and that’s about it. We got pretty much all the dining options we wanted which is good considering that we are following free dining week just before ours. The only dining experience that we are having trouble with is “Chef Mickeys”. We got two reservations but both are terrible time slots.  One thing we hope to do before our trip in less than 100 days is keep checking for open reservations. Luckily we have a Disney travel agent to help with this, but that doesn’t mean I don’t keep checking as well. I check maybe once a week to see if anyone has canceled a previous reservation, but the real odds of cancelations come a day or two before. I have two reservations set up because I’m not sure which one we will use yet, if any. So if I’m canceling at least one of them a day or two before hand and hoping that someone else is doing the same.</p>
	<h3>Scheduling Fast Passes</h3>
		<p>This is by far my favorite part. The parades, the fireworks, the character meet and greets, and all of that is great, but my favorite part is the rides and shows. If you are staying on site at Disney, you get the luxury of scheduling your Fast Passes 60 days before your trip. If you are staying off-site, then you can schedule your Fast Passes at 30 days. Below I’m going to list out what I’m going to try and attempt to get with my Fast Passes and in a later post reveal what I actually got:</p>
		<p> Below is what I’m going to shoot for when scheduling FP</p>

	<h3>Order your Magic Bands</h3>
		<p>You can order some really, special Magic Bands or just the originals. You will need to have these Bands picked out by at least 30 days before your trip. The original colors consist of: gray, purple, red, green, orange, yellow, blue, and pink. There are some special edition ones that are pretty cool like: Star Wars, Elsa, and Seven Dwarfs.</p>

	<h3>Get your gear together</h3>
		<p>Getting ready to go is the last step of this journey. There are a few things you need to make sure you have ready before you go. You will need to look at your map and see what route you are taking. You will need to begin buying things for your trip, like snacks, bug spray, sun screen, your matching outfits (we wont do this, but its ok if you do), and other incidentals you may need. Don’t forget to pack enough underwear, your Magic Bands, and your tickets!</p>
		<p> We are getting down to the wire. You hear 100 days and you think you are in good shape, but those 100 days will move real quick. Before you know if we will be in Disney and seeing all our beloved characters and riding all our favorite rides.</p>
