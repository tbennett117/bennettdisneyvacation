      	<section class="d23_intro">
      	<p> If you've been living under a rock this past weekend or don't follow Disney news as close as I do, then you may have missed all the cool news coming out of the D23 Expo that took place in Anaheim California. Movies that are coming to the big screen, new attractions in the Parks, and other amazing news came out the weekend. While I primarily keep up with Disney World news, I do want to at least mention the new movies coming out. So what did we find out from the D23 expo? Well lets jump right in.
      	</p>
      	<h5 class="d23_movies">Announced Movies:</h5>
      <ol class="movielist">
      	<li>Toy Story 4</li>
      		<p>Some people may say another Toy Story? This adventure will be different than the previous 3, but should keep in line with many of the same themes. This makes sense considering that Disney is investing a lot in Toy Story Land (more on that latter). I for one am curious for the new movie because supposedly it centers around Woody and Bo-Peep. Bo-Peep was missing from Toy Story 3 so I'm wondering where she has been and how Woody goes about looking for her. I think my kids will also enjoy another Toy Story. My youngest loves Woody and Buzz! The date set for Toy Story 4 is June 21st, 2019. </p>
      	<li>Wreck it Ralph</li>
      		<p>I wasn't a fan of the first Wreck it Ralph so I probably won't be as interested in this one. My son liked the original but I think he may have aged out this new one. Ralph is set to premier November 21st, 2018.</p>
      	<li>Coco</li>
      		<p>Coco is set to come out this fall. We knew this movie was coming out a while back but Disney gave some screen time so I'll mention it here. I'm actually excited about this movie. I think it will be a different type of Disney Movie and I like they are giving it a Hispanic vibe. I'm not sure this movie will be for my younger kids considering its a movie about dead people, but my older ones may enjoy it.</p>
      	<li>The Incredibles 2</li>
      		<p>Another movie that I'm excited about. All my kids enjoy watching the first Incredibles. They also enjoy playing as the family on the original Disney Infinity game. I cannot wait to see what adventure this Super Hero family has in store for us next summer, June 15th, 2018.</p>
      	<li>Dumbo</li>
      	<li>Aladdin</li>
      		<p>This will be another live action Disney Movie. So far Disney has not dissappointed with the live action movies. For a studio known for its animation, they struck gold with developing original movies into Live Action. I grew up in the 90's so I know how big Aladdin was. This movie will be a huge hit. Many will go just to see Will Smith as the Genie.</p>
      	<li>The Lion King</li>
      		<p>Another live action Disney Classic. Jon Favreau made the original Jungle Book into a blockbuster. What he was able to do in that movie gives me hope that this movie will be another huge success. Lion King was my jam when I was a kid. I'm excited about this movie more than any other. I wasn't at the Expo, but I heard this movie got a huge ovation.</p>
      	<li>The Jungle Cruise</li>
      		<p>No, not the ride! However it is based on the ride. I'm also excited about this one. The Rock will star in this movie so you know it will be a good one. Disney made Pirates of the Caribbean ride into a movie and had international success. I'm not ready to say this movie will have equal success to Pirates, but with the Rock it has the potential.</p>
      	<li>Avengers: Infinity War</li>
      		<p>People at the expo was in awe of this movie. Words could not describe how they were feeling upon viewing the sneek peak of this movie. All they could do was just list every single hero that was in the movie(hint: there were a lot). This should be another gem for Disney: Marvels. I will say I don't follow Marvels movies as close as I do other genres, but this one has me pretty excited.</p>

   	<h5 class="d23_parkinfo">Park Info</h5>
    	<ol class="parknews">
     	<li>Star Wars Galaxy Edge</li>
     		<p>This will be the name of the new Star Wars section of Hollywood studios. There will be new rides, new characters, and a new overall experience when you visit Disney Hollywood Studios in 2019.</p>
     		<iframe width="360" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aP1jcbPRxc8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
     	<li>Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway</li>
     		<p>This new attraction will be replacing Great Movie Ride. In the ride you will be in a cartoon and it will feature 2 1/2D where no 3D glasses will be needed to get the full effect.  </p>
     	<li>Toy Story Land</li>
     		<p>This was announced last year at D23 but we have a date from this years expo. This part of Hollywood Studios will open Summer 2018. They have already expanded Toy Story Mania, but they are also adding a new family friendly coaster called Slinky Dog Dash, and Alien Swirling Saucers (Watch out for the Claw!) </p>
     	<li>New Ratatouille ride</li>
     		<p>This will be a new attraction to help Epcot. It will be just past the Eiffel Tower in the France.</p>
     	<li>Guardians of the Galaxy</li>
     		<p>Not sure what all this will entail, but it will give a nice boost to Epcot. </p>
     	<li>Tron Ride</li>
     		<p>This will be in Tomorrowland right near Space Mountain. If you're curious to what this ride will look like then just look for videos of the same ride in Shanghai Disney.</p>
     		<iframe width="360" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/taeucixxrdM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
     	<li>New Theatre in Main Street U.S.A</li>
		  </ol>
     	<h5 class="d23_resort">Resort Info</h5>
     		<ol class="resortnews">
     			<li>Disney Riviera Resort</li>
     				<p>This will be a new resort for Disney Vacation Club members.</p>
     			<li>Star Wars Resort</li>
     				<p>Keeping with the theme of Star Wars Galaxy's Edge, a resort themed in Star Wars seems like the next step. This resort should bring in all the Star Wars people. Sounds like a pretty cool little resort.</p>
